# GLPlot
First of all, a few things actually got less comfortable.

That's because I stopped acting like I have a scene Graph and now fully expose the render loop. I think this offers greater flexibility for early adopters.

That means instead of display I rather expose the function toopengl, which I intend to use to build up the scene graph later on.

Also I'm not fully happy with the API, but that is to be expected, as I haven't figured out the scene graph and its interaction with React yet.

BUT, I have most of the pieces together now, to do the basic render operations, which you would expect from a 3D plotting package and most of the render attributes can be be time changing signals, which enables nice animation capabilities.

You can find examples with a few comments in GLPlot/examples

By the way, all shaders are interactive now by default.

That means you can just run the example, open a shader in a text editor, edit something, save -> et voil√† =)

For example if you run example/surface.jl, GLPlot/src/shader/phongblinn.frag might be interesting.

Or volume.jl and GLPlot/src/shader/iso.frag.

2D geometry projected on z-value grid:

![Iso-surface](2dgeom/surf.png "sin(x)+sin(y)+sin(z)")

Same without seams (Surface Plot):

![Iso-surface](example/surf.png "sin(x)+sin(y)+sin(z)")

Iso surface:

![Iso-surface](example/iso.png "sin(x)+sin(y)+sin(z)")

Best,
